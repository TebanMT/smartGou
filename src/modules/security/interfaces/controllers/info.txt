This is a info file for the controller directory.

For the init of the project, we are using lambdas to handle the requests.

Thats why this directory is empty. 

The controllers are implemented in the lambda functions and put in the lambda directory.

The idea of this directory is to have a place to migrate the controllers to a different technology, for example, a rest api.

In that manner if the project grows, we can migrate to a rest api and containerize the application without affecting the business logic.
